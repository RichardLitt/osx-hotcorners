# osx-hotcorners

> Automatically save and reset OSX Hotcorners

## Install

```
$ npm i -g osx-hotcorners
```

## Usage

To run, open your terminal and run:

```
$ hotcorners
```

This will run the script which will change the hotcorners. By default, in anti-clockwise order from the top left: Put Display to Sleep, Application Windows, Desktop, and Mission Control.

There currently is not an option to set up your own settings for the hotcorners, or to return the previous settings; it will reset to the options above. Please open an issue if you'd like to work on this.
